  <h2 align="center">Cracker Hash (Python)</h2>

  <p align="center">
    
A "crack hash" typically refers to a cryptographic hash function that has been compromised or broken in such a way that its outputs (hash values) can be easily reverse-engineered or "cracked" to reveal the original input data, such as a password or other sensitive information.
    Of course, don't do this for fun, hacking is not a game, it's dangerous and illegal. So don't do stupid things, be kind like us
    I'm not encouraging anyone to hack or anything. I want you to learn ethical hacking.
